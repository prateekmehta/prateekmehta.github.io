Sometimes, someone asks for what you want? you may try to be "easy" by not answering what exactly you want, and say whatever you want, but infact you are being the exact opposite of easy by not saying what you want...because it may make the other person feel as if you are doing everything as a big favor to them. If the intent is to make them feel that, then you are just being a jerk! better not do it, but if the intent is not to make them feel that, then you should definitly not do it!
